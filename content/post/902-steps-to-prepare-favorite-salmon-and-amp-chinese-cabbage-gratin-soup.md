Displaced native Middle English lax, from Old English leax. Salmon are native to tributaries of the North Atlantic (genus Salmo ) and Pacific Ocean (genus Oncorhynchus ). Oncorhynchus is a genus of fish in the family Salmonidae; it contains the six species of Pacific salmon (Chinook, coho, sockeye, pink, chum, masu).
