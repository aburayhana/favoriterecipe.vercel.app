recipeingredient:
- "1-2 scaled fish fillets per person bass bream haddock hake or snapper as long as they are not too thick 11  inch"
- " salt and pepper"
- " plain flour for dusting optional"
- " oil for frying"
- "1 tbsp. butter"
- " lemon wedges for serving"
- " For the creamed spinach"
- "300 g fresh spinach or a bag of frozen"
- "1 tbsp. butter"
- "2 cloves garlic peeled and pressed"
- "200 ml double cream"
- "1/2 tsp grated nutmeg"
- " salt and pepper"
- "3-4 tbsp. grated Parmesan"
recipeinstructions:
- "For the creamed spinach: thaw the frozen spinach, wash the leaves if using fresh. Blanch it with boiling water or microwave for 3-4 minutes on full power. Leave to cool."
- "Squeeze most moisture from either the blanched or the thawed spinach and chop it roughly."
- "Melt the butter in a medium pan, add the pressed garlic and let it sizzle for a few seconds. Pour in the cream and turn up the heat. Season with the nutmeg, salt and pepper and cook down for about 3 minutes. Stir in the grated cheese and cook for further 2 or 3 minutes. Add the spinach to the mixture, stir in and cook on medium heat with the lid on for 10 minutes plus further 5 or 10 with the lid off, to let most of the liquid evaporate."
- "Now cook the fish: rinse the fillets and pat dry very well, especially the skin side. Score the skin across two or three times on each fillet. Season the skin side with salt and pepper and lightly dust with flour if you like, shake off the excess."
- "Heat a little oil in a heavy pan or skillet – make sure it’s very hot. Place the fillets in the pan, skin side down and press gently with a fish slice to stop them curling. Season the flesh side with salt and pepper. Cook for about 3 minutes until the flesh around the edges turns opaque and the skin is crisp."
- "Turn off the heat and flip the fillets over – they will cook on the residual heat in the pan. Add a knob of butter and swirl it around, basting the fish. Leave the fillets there for a minute. Transfer to warm plates and serve with the spinach."
