recipeingredient:
- "180 grams Spaghetti or Fettucine if available"
- "1 1/2 tbsp to 2 liters of water Salt for boiling the pasta"
- "1 Olive oil"
- "70 grams Salted pork  seeor thickly cut bacon"
- "2 large Fresh Egg"
- "4 tbsp Parmigiano Reggiano grated Or use pregrated parmesan cheese"
- "1 Coarsely ground black pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Bring a large pot of well-salted water and boil the pasta. (For a chewy pasta and for seasoning)."
- "[Basic] Boil with well-salted water to make the pasta well seasoned and give it a clearer taste. It&#39;s not necessary to add more salt when stirring the pasta in a frying pan."
- "In a large bowl, beat the egg with the Parmigiano Reggiano, black pepper, and salt until the egg becomes fluffy."
- "Heat olive oil in a frying pan. Fry the pork with low heat. The pork fat releases oil so you don&#39;t need to use too much. If there&#39;s too much oil, take it off with a paper towel."
- "When the pork is crispy, cool it down a bit and put it into the bowl with the eggs. Add the fat from the pork, too. (←it has a good taste)"
- "When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with pasta tongs and put it in the bowl and mix it. Tip: Don&#39;t drain the pasta too much. Use the heat of the pasta to coat the strands well with the egg liquid."
- "Serve topped with Parmesan cheese (not listed in the ingredients) and a generous amount of ground pepper. Enjoy! This classic recipe is really simple, and tastes rich but not cloying."
- "Who added cream to Carbonara, the Americans? Or was it the Japanese? The authentic taste is similar to the classic Japanese dish of raw egg mixed with hot rice."
