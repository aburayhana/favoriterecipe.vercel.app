- "While you&#39;re browning the hamburger and onions, boil the cubes of the potatoes on another burner to save time. Boil until you take a piece of potato out and take a fork and see if it mashes easily with the fork. Takes about 10 minutes to make the potatoes soft enough to mash with a fork"
- "After the meat is browned. Spread the hamburger at the bottom of the aluminum tin to make the bottom layer."
- "Then strain the potatoes out of the pot. Then put the potatoes from the strainer into the pot you just used. Then put in the pot the 1/2 cup of milk and take a fork and mash the potatoes. Keep mashing with the fork and stirring the potatoes. When they&#39;re all mashed if it&#39;s not the consistency you want if you want it more watery then add more milk."
- "After the potatoes are the right consistency, add the cream cheese not all at once but in bits and taste while you&#39;re adding to get the flavor of the potatoes that you want."
- "Take the 2 cans of corn and make a layer of corn over the hamburger in the cake tin."
- "Take the potatoes that taste the way you want and spread it on top of the corn. To make a layer that doesn&#39;t mix with the corn, pour the potatoes in clumps all over the corn and then carefully spread the potatoes to make the top layer."
- "Take the 2 cups of shredded cheese and layer the top of the potatoes."
- "Take the tin with the shepherds pie and put it in the oven at 325° for 20 minutes or longer if you want the potatoes browner."
- "Then eat and enjoy. Great meal that doesn&#39;t take too long!!"
