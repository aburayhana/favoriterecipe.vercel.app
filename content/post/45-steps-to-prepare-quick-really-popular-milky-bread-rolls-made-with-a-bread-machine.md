- "2 1/2 grams Salt"
- "10 grams Condensed milk"
- "20 grams Unsalted butter at room temperature"
- "145 grams Milk"

recipeinstructions:
- "Add the ● ingredients into the bread machine in the order listed, and let the machine handle the dough until the first rising."
- "After the first rising has ended, divide the dough into 8 equal portions and shape into balls, cover with a well-wrung out cloth, and let rest for 10 minutes."
- "Shape the dough into balls again after it has rested. Lightly press down on the dough to deflate it. (You can press the dough on your palms.)"
- "Pinch the outside of the dough, and roll it back up. (Use the palm of your hand for this as well)."
- "Neaten up and line the rolled dough up on a cookie sheet. Cover with a well-wrung out cloth and let rise for the second time until 1.5~2 times the size. (The dough will rise rapidly in the summer, leave it to proof in a cool room)."
- "This photo shows the dough after it has risen for the second time. Take this time to preheat the oven to 180°C."
- "Lightly sprinkle the surface with bread flour, and cut a slit into the front with a knife that cuts well."
- "Slash the tops of the rolls."
- "Bake in an oven preheated to 180°C for about 15 minutes, and it is done!"
- "These rolls have a milky, subtly sweet fragrance! Eat with pasta or stew. They&#39;re also delicious on their own!"
- "If you break the rolls apart like this after they&#39;ve cooled down a bit and still warm, they&#39;re so fluffy and moist!  I recommend this bread for kids with egg allergies."
