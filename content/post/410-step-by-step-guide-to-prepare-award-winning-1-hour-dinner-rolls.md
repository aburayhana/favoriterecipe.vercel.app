recipeingredient:
- "1 cup water"
- "1/2 cup milk"

- "1 tbsp. activedry yeast"
- "3 1/2-4 cups all purpose flour divided"
- "1 tsp. salt"

recipeinstructions:
- "In a microwave safe bowl or measuring cup, combine the water, milk, melted butter and honey. Microwave for 1 minute, then give it a stir. Then microwave in 15 second intervals until it is warm, but not hot. It should be between 100-115째F. Pour the mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer and sprinkle the yeast over the top. Give it a quick stir, then let it sit for about 5 minutes, until the yeast is foamy."
- "Add 3 1/2 cups of the flour and the salt to the stand mixer bowl (with the dough hook attachment) and turn the speed to med-low speed until the dry ingredients are incorporated in. If the dough is still sticking to the sides of the bowl, then add in more flour 1/4 cup at a time until the dough pulls away from the bowl and is only slightly sticky to the touch. Don&#39;t exceed 4 cups flour, total."
- "Switch to low speed and continue to mix for 4-5 minutes. Then form the dough into a ball with your hands and place it into a bowl greased with olive oil. Cover the bowl with a damp towel and let it sit for 15 minutes to rise slightly."
- "Preheat the oven to 400째F. Grease a 9x13&#34; baking pan with olive oil and set aside."
- "Punch down the dough gently and divide it into 12-15 equal sized pieces (the original recipe calls for 15. I make mine slightly bigger and get 12). Roll the pieces into a ball and place them into the prepared baking pan. Then cover the pan with a damp towel and let the dough balls rise for an additional 20 minutes."
- "Bake for 12-15 minutes, until the rolls are golden brown on top. Then remove them from the oven and brush them with the melted salted butter."
- "That&#39;s it! Seperate the rolls and serve them up."
