recipeingredient:
- "210 grams Bread strong flour"
- "80 grams Bread starter made with natural yeast liquid"
- "13 grams Sugar or light brown sugar"
- "4 grams Salt"
- "100 ml Water"
recipeinstructions:
- "I used a starter mixture made from 50ml natural yeast liquid (this time I used raisins) and 50g bread flour."
- "Add the water, starter mix, sugar, domestic flour, and salt to the bread maker in order, and start it on the dough making course!"
- "Let it sit as-is after the dough course has finished (since it takes time for the homemade natural yeast to ferment)."

- "Punch down the dough, roll back up, and let rise for the second time. (It took about 2 hours in the oven for me. It will vary according to the room temperature on the day you make it, so please keep an eye on it while misting with water from time to time.)"
- "Once it has swelled to about 1.5 times the size, bake in the oven at 180℃ for about 16 minutes, and it is done."
