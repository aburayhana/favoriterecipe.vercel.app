- "A. Tangzhong - Mix flour and milk in a small pot and whisk until there is no lump. Heat this mixture over low heat, keep stirring until it thickens. Tangzhong is ready when the spoon used to stir leaves a visible trail all the way to the bottom of the pan or it turns into a thick paste. Turn off the heat and leave to cool completely.

- "The same order of mixing the ingredients applied if using a stand mixer with dough hook attachment. Since this recipe uses INSTANT yeast, skip dissolving yeast in the liquid.

Leave to rise for 1 - 1 1/2 hours or until dough doubled in size. Proceed to step 5."
- "Transfer dough to a generously floured worktop. Dust dough and hands before working on the sticky dough. Punch down the dough and divide into 16 equal portions. Roll each portion into ball. Place rolls on a lightly greased baking tray and cover with lightly greased plastic food wrap. Allow rolls to rise again in a warm area for 40 minutes or until they doubled in size. Meantime, preheat oven to 160°C - 170°C, depending the oven, adjust accordingly as appliance varies."

Remove from the oven and brush tops with melted butter. Immediately, transfer rolls to a cooling rack. Leave to cool completely before storing."
