recipeingredient:
- "100 grams Strong bread flour"
- "1 1/2 tbsp Sugar"
- "1 tbsp  skimmed milk powder"
- "1 tsp Instant dried yeast"
- "100 grams Strong bread flour"
- "150 ml Milk"
- "1/2 tsp Salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the skimmed milk powder with the sugar and mix well. (This is to prevent the skimmed milk powder sucking up the moisture and lumping)."
- "Add the bread flour to a bowl. Add the sugar and skimmed milk powder on top of that and then the yeast on top."
- "Add some milk warmed up to approx. 40°C, pour it onto the yeast, and mix well until the yeast has dissolved."
- "When you add the milk we want the mixture to become a bit sticky. If the weather is dry sometimes the mixture will harden instead, so if this is the case try adding more milk."
- "Add the salt and the rest of the bread flour and once the dough has clumped together turn it out onto a counter. Knead until smooth."
- "At first it will be sticky and crumbly."
- "Once smooth, gather the dough into a ball, closing up any cracks, and transfer to a bowl. Wrap with cling film and proof at 40℃ for 40 - 45 minutes."
- "When it&#39;s done proving, insert a finger dusted in bread flower slowly into the middle. If the hole doesn&#39;t close up when you take your finger out, the bread is ready."
- "Separate into 6 equal parts and roll into balls. Leave to rest for 10 minutes covered with a well wrung cloth."
- "Roll the shapes back into balls. Place on a baking tray that has been dusted with sifted bread flour."
- "Sift some more bread flour over the tops of the rolls and make a linear indentation with a pair of chopsticks on the top. Leave to prove for a second time at 40℃ for 20 minutes."
- "Once proven again, they should expand slightly. Bake in oven preheated to 170 - 180℃ for 12 - 15 minutes. (Baking time will vary according to oven though so keep an eye on it)."
- "All done!"
- "If they&#39;re golden on the bottom as well as the top they&#39;re done."
- "They should look like this when broken apart."
- "This is what they look like when cut, you can see the fine grain here."
