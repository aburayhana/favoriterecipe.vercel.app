- "Bake for 25 - 30 minutes until the pastry is crisp and golden. Slice into quarters and serve with a nice green salad"
- "Great if you have any other leftover vegetables - I often add onion, baby corn, asparagus, squash, anything I have sitting around! A squeeze of lemon and a sprinkle of sugar tastes great over the roasted veg too"
