- " Bread dough"
- "200 grams Bread strong flour"
- "20 grams Whole egg"
- "2 grams Salt"
- "20 grams Castor sugar"
- "3 grams Instant dry yeast"
- "110 grams Water"

- " Toppings"
- "20 grams Walnuts"
- "10 grams Sliced almonds"
- " Icing"
- "30 grams Powdered sugar"
- "1/2 tsp Water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Bring the butter and egg to room temperature."
- "Toast the walnuts for 7 minutes in a 180℃ oven (no need to pre-heat)."
- "When the walnuts have cooled slightly, crush with your hands into fairly small bits."
- "Strain the egg through a sieve. You will need 20 g for the bread dough, and the rest can be set aside for later."
- "If you have a bread machine, put all of the ingredients into the bread pan and turn it on! (If kneading by hand, see.)  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/144640-quick-and-easy-bean-sprouts-and-satsuma-age-fish-cakes-mixed-with-an-egg"
- "In the meantime, make the filling. Work quickly."
- "For this recipe, I would recommend cutting the apples into 5 mm-1 cm slices, as opposed to wedges."
- "When the apples have cooled a bit, drain them well in a colander."
- "When the bread maker finishes, do a &#34;finger check&#34; (coat your finger with flour and poke a hole in the dough. If it doesn&#39;t spring back, you know that the first rising is complete)."
- "If the dough springs back, it hasn&#39;t finished rising. Let it sit for about another 5 minutes."
- "If the dough has shrunk, it means you have let it rise too much. There&#39;s nothing you can do about this, so it&#39;s best just to proceed to the next step, bearing in mind that your rolls might not turn out the greatest!"
- "Carefully take the dough out of the bread machine with a bench scraper. Punch down the dough."
- "Shape the dough into a ball. Make it nice and smooth. Close the seam tightly on the bottom."
- "Cover with a damp cloth and let rest for 15 minutes."
- "Place the dough seam-side up and, using a rolling pin, lightly mark the dough with a cross."
- "Roll out the dough, but leave approx. 1 cm on either end un-rolled (this helps achieve an even thickness)."
- "Roll out the dough into a 25 cm square. (This is easiest if you work from the centre, leaving the top, bottom, and sides until the very end)."
- "Thoroughly drain the apple filling and spread it out on the dough, leaving 2 cm at the end furthest from you empty."
- "Roll it up from the end nearest you. Close the seam tightly, as you did when making the dough."
- "Cut the dough into 6 pieces with a bench scraper (start by cutting it in half, then cut each half into 3 pieces.)"
- "Spread out the aluminum foil baking cups and place a roll in each cup. Let rise once more, this time at 40°C on your oven&#39;s &#39;bread rising&#39; setting."
- "This is what they look like after the second rising."
- "Pre-heat the oven to 190°C. While waiting for it to heat, brush the rolls with the leftover egg and top with sliced almonds and walnuts."
- "When heated, pop them into the oven for 12 minutes. Adjust the baking time according to your oven."
- "Take the rolls out of the oven and cool on a wire rack..."
- "Mix together the icing ingredients until thick (make sure not to over-mix or it&#39;ll be hard). Drizzle the icing on the rolls!"
- "Even if you just drizzle it on at random, these will look surprisingly professional when finished, so don&#39;t worry too much. And with that, you&#39;re done!"
