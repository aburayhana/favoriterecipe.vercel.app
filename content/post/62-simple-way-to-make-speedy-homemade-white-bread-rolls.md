recipeingredient:
- "250 grams Strong bread flour"
- "160 ml Homemade liquid yeast if the yeast is very active then a blend of 12 yeast and 12 water is also fine"
- "20 grams Sugar"
- "30 grams Butter or margarine"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put all of the ingredients into a bread machine and set to knead until smooth."
- "After the kneading is finished, remove the kneading blade."
- "Form into a slightly flat ball, (or leave as is)."
- "Wrap the bread machine in plastic wrap."
- "In the summer, the bread should rise in about 6 hours indoors without air conditioning. During the other seasons, allow it to rise for 6 hours in the bread machine on the yeast-starter setting or the bread-rising setting."
- "If not using the dough rising setting, it will take 8 to 10 hours in the spring and fall at 20°C (room temperature), or 12 to 15 hours in the winter at less than 20°C."
- "The yeast was a bit too strong, so this rose a bit too much, but because it&#39;s made beginning with liquid yeast and without a starter, there will be no sour taste."
- "Transfer the dough to a dusted work surface."
- "Divide and roll into balls, wrap in plastic or vinyl, then let rest for 30 minutes."
- "Form the rolls into your desired shape. (I made mine into round balls.)"
- "Wrap in plastic wrap or vinyl, and let the dough rise for a second proving. (In the summer, it should take 60 to 70 minutes in a room without AC, and 90 minutes in the spring and fall, 120 minutes in the winter in an unheated room)"
- "Please adjust the rising time depending on the room temperature and strength of the yeast. The dough should rise 2.5 to 3 times in height."
- "Sprinkle with bread flour over the rolls, then bake for 12 minutes at 150°C without letting it brown."
- "They&#39;re done! You&#39;ll be surprised at the taste--it&#39;s different from bread made from dry yeast! Your mouth will be filled with the delicious taste of flour and butter."
- "Or apply an egg wash, then bake for about 15 minutes at 180°C to make French rolls. You can also use this dough for making deli bread or sweet bread."
