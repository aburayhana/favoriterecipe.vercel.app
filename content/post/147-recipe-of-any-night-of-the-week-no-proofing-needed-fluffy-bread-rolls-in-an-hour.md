recipeinstructions:
- "Into a microwave-safe bowl, pour in the milk, add butter and microwave for 30 seconds at 600W (high) without covering with a lid or plastic wrap."

- "Continue mixing with a chopstick, so the dough comes together."
- "Once the dough from Step 5 has come together, cover with parchment paper, and microwave for 30 seconds at 150-200W (low). → Allow the dough to rise."
