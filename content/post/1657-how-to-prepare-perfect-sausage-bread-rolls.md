Place the Dough inside a very large oiled Bowl (making sure you smear some oil on the surface of the Dough) and leave to rise in a warm place for 1 hour or till doubled in size."

- "Be sure to measure accurately. You can see both the standard and the metric measurements below Bring all your ingredients to room temperature bere combining them. Except for the milk â€“ that needs to be warm.  When making bread, always use bowls that are large enough to accommodate the size of the dough when it doubled or tripled in size."
- "This sausage bread can be made in bulk because it freezes so well. If you choose to freeze them, be sure to let the rolls to come to room temperature. Put them in a Ziploc or tightly sealed plastic bag and store in the freezer. You need to let them thaw before warming them. You can place them in the oven to warm up or microwave for a minute or two.  These bread rolls are perfect for breakfast, dinner or even snack time and it will definitely create a memorable taste for you and your family."
