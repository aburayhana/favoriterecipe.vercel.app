recipeinstructions:

- "Now I like to put melt my cheese in the oven on Warm. Add meat to any oven safe dish. (small casserol dish) Place generous amount of provolone all over top of meat. Place in oven on Warm until cheese is melted. About 2-4 minutes."
- "Remove meat from oven. Use spatula to place meat on Steak rolls. Add onions and green peppers on top. Generously spread your garlic horseradish mayo on top bun and enjoy!"
